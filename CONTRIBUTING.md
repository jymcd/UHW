# Contributing

## Security
Because master is downloaded from by the program for updating, master must at all times be free of malice and dysfunctional code.

Dysfunctional code as a result of the final offical commit made by me is pardoned for now as I can't patch it.

## Merges
Merging will be a natively slower process as each change must be checked for function and to prevent malice before being merged with master

## Becoming a Member Contributor
Becoming a Member Contributor permits you to commit code with less checks allowing quicker code changes and updates.
Furthermore, you will get a say in decisions about the repository and conflicting merges.
Finally, you can help speed up review processes by reviewing merges yourself and publically submitting your review

### Requirements
First we will check for prior work to ensure you are not producing malicious code, and produce reliable code.

Second we will determine if you are of reliable character. Member Contributers have reduced checks to prevent bad code from entering the system

### Restrictions
Commits to the master branch are forbidden. File a Pull Request from a branch in the offical repository or a branch from a fork.

Reviewing pull requests are permitted and will be considered but permission to commit the merge is not granted. Reviewing one's own request is not considered.
