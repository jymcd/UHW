Unmanaged Harddrive Wrapper for OpenComputers

This wrapper is designed to allow access to unmanaged harddrives as if they are managed.

## Reading
Reading worked for previous versions however due to half-finished updates this branch currently has no functioning read system.

## Writing
Writing has been featured in the last half-finished updates.

## The Future
Personally I am working on seperate projects and as such rely on support from the community. However, if possible, I will at some point pick this
this project up, and update things such as writing, reading, and... wait that's everything. Oh shoot. This readme. Okay?

## Issues
For any issues encountered with the code, submit an issue in the Github Repository.
